# Gitart

Heavily inspired by [gitfiti](https://github.com/gelstudios/gitfiti).

Please create a new GitHub repo (tip: make it a private repo). Then, run `main.rkt`, and run the generated `gitart.sh`.

You need to run `export GITART_REPO_NAME=your_repo_name` and `export GITART_USERNAME=your_github_username` before running the script.

Your GitHub commit history will now look like you commited something every day for the past year.
